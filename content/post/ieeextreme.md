I teamed up with Samuel Horvath to participate in a competition called "IEEEXtreme" organized by IEEE for students worldwide. We got ranked 123 worldwide or 43 in our Region (Africa, Europe and Middle East). Unfortunately, we didn't get in top 100, so we are not going to get T-shirts as a prize, but the competition was extremely fun and it was cool to work with Samuel in a team.

Official results are available here:
