I was selected to be one of 120 students invited to the Vatican to participate in a hackathon. Hackathon's theme are (1) social inclusion, (2) interfaith dialogue and (3) migrants & refugees. I am no expert in religions or migrants problems, so I applied and got accepted to participate addressing the first theme.

The even is organized by OPTIC - "an organization founded in 2012 dedicated to research and innovation regarding the ethics of new and disruptive technologies". More details can be found on this webpage:

I don't have a good hackathon participations record, but I believe it will be amazing :) It is especially nice to represent KAUST in such an event.
