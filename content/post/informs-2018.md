In September Peter suggested me to take part in organizing a few sessions at INFORMS Optimization Society Conference. Since I had no idea of what it means back then, I decided to first try with just one. In addition, I could choose to invite either 3 or 4 speakers, and I decided to go for the former option. It allowed me to choose speakers carefully, but unfortunately I didn't foresee that one of the speakers I invited may not be able to come. So now I am going to be a speaker there as well, which is a common phenomenon, though I rather wanted to listen than to present.
