# Bio

##### I'm currently staying at Rutgers University, working with Mert Gurbuzbalaban.

I'm a PhD student under the supervision of <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/updates">Peter Richtárik</a>, working on Optimization and its applications to Machine Learning. Prior to this, I was a research intern at Université Grenoble Alpes, where I studied an algorithm for Distributed Optimization with F. Iutzeler and J. Malick. This internship allowed me to obtain my double degree MSc diploma from École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay and Paris-Dauphine. I obtained my BSc from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, where I was having a lot of fun with quantum mechanics and various branches of classical physics. My bachelor's thesis, however, was devoted to statistical learning theory.

My hobbies include squash, bouldering and competitive programming.
